17. Delete Low Earners
Objective: Delete all employees earning less than 50000, then list remaining IDs and Salaries.

Expected Output:

EmployeeID | Salary
1          | 58000.00
2          | 72000.00
4          | 61000.00
6          | 80000.00
7          | 53000.00
8          | 55000.00
9          | 52000.00
10         | 58000.00
11         | 47000.00*

*if Karen’s 47000 is considered—otherwise she’d be removed here too.
